        " You begin by inhabiting the dead body of a warrior, rising from the musty earth the powerful warrior's body begins to morph to your shape. Slowly you inbide the corpse's memories, taking them almost as your own, like coming from a coma your connection with your host body is hazy, but with a little use his abilities quickly feel natural.\n\n Arisen, you are in a clearing surrounded by a dark woodland, your clothes are moss covered and beginning to rot, the evening is cold. It seems you will remain here until the world is freed of the magic that pulled you here, or death finds you.\n\n You Find the items that had been on your person stashed inside an ornate wooden chest covered in strange symbols. The boxâ€™s energy slowly fades, it now seems to be merely but a strangely decorated wooden box.\n\n -- THE WORLD -- \n\n The world has no name, for none know more that much further beyond their village. It is a cold world, men and dwarves toil to survive the vicious unforgiving world. The forest grows, and grows, forever hardy, forever dangerous, but plentiful.\nMost subside through a mixture of farming and hunting, building up stores to survive the beasts the prey through winter. The men of this world are untrusting, but hardy and loyal, they have braved great terror before and are ready to do so again. But deep in the dark woods a terror grows, biding and spreading its influence among the wild and free beasts is gaining, soon no power of the intelligent races will be enough to stop the coming tide.",
